# Solidifying [[NW Side Control]]

- With opponent’s elbow framed in your hip, you can be easily swept
- You have to remove opponent’s frame from your hips

## Knee Drive Method - Hip Check Method

1. Take your underhook arm and place it down on mat towards opponent’s hip line for stability
2. Walk down your hips to cover opponent’s hips
    1. This causes opponent’s hips to turn away from you
    2. You are now nearly on top of opponent’s hips, restricting movement and preventing opponent from turning into you
3. Turn your knees and hips in (Away from opponent’s head)
4. With hips turned in, walk back up the torso, pushing opponent’s elbow past their shoulder line
5. Walk until your knee and elbow of cross face arm
6. Arm is now trapped

**Notes:**
- The underhook will be given up for stability, but will be regained after the movement
- The posted arm can post against opponent’s far side leg to push when walking back up

# Goals

- Break posture and shut down escapes
- Pinning pressure that threatens breathing
- Shifting body position to move into submission
- Convert pin to submission
    - Elbow Penetration
    - Elbow Separation: Away from the body (And preferably above shoulder line)

# [[The 5 Pins of Jiu-Jitsu]]

### Notes:
- More points scored for leg/hip pins
    - Free hands for submissions and strikes
- Opponents elbows need to be past their centerline of their torso or away from torso
    - Best way (MMA/Self Defense) is striking

# Mechanics of Pinning

- Your body weight is not the most important part of pinning
- Obstacles (Wedges) around the opponents body is most important
    - Restrains movement, such as shrimping
- Body weight reinforces these wedges
    - Points to wedge: (Note: Get under the body to wedge. Like a door stop.)
        - Hip line
        - Shoulder line
-  An example of effective wedges: [[Side Control]]

# Two Big Themes of New Wave Pinning

### Wedges beat body weight

- Your pin will break if held static

### Movement always beats static immobilization

- **Timestamp 34 min**
- Dynamic pinning is important
    - Move from pin to pin as they attempt to escape

### Notes on Dynamic Pinning

**Example: (Side Control to North-South to Other Side Control)**

From [[Side Control]]:
- As opponent moves their knees into your hip line to attain guard, move hip side arm/far side arm (currently an underhook/under opponent’s body) back to your torso
- Then take hip side arm around opponent’s butt to block them from coming into the hip line
- From here, you move into North-South then transition to side control on other side

# Converting Pins to Submissions

- Path to submission is through opponent’s elbows

### Two Keys of Conversion:

- **Elbow Penetration:** Can be accomplished through:
    - Penetrating your hand/wrist under opponent’s elbow
    - Penetrating your hand/wrist between opponent’s upper arm (bicep area) and rib cage
    - Can penetrate from the inside or outside
        - Changing the direction from which you penetrate changes the submissions available
- **Elbow Separation**
    - The elbow is weak when taken above the shoulder-line, past center-line, and away from torso

# Mounted Position Reflections

**CONS:**

- Less Stable
- Center of gravities lined up
- Your legs are less mobile in mount, easier for opponent to escape
- Opponent’s elbow position:
    - Needs to be past center or above shoulder-line
- Elbows to sides (T. Rex Arms) is one of the most strongest body position
    - Requires specific methods to move elbow
    - Brute strength won’t work

**PROS:**

- Gordon Ryan & Roger Gracie actively used mount:
    - Both knew to fight the elbows
- Directly interfere with opponent’s breathing
    - More important than the discomfort of knee-on-belly or side control

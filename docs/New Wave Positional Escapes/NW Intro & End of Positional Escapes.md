# New Wave Positional Escapes
New Wave Positional Escapes Vol. 1, 8
# Intro
- Defense is the source of all attacking confidence
- 1st step to building an aggressive player is to build defense
- 50% of training time should be dedicated to defense

## Traditional Approach to Defense
3 Types of positions:

1. Dominant
2. Neutral
3. Inferior

Traditionally you work from inferior to neutral, then to dominant. Not wrong, but not optimal.

  A["Bottom Mount (Inferior)"] -- Elbow Escape --> B["Closed Guard (Neutral)"];
  B -- Sweep --> C["Top Mount (Dominant)"];
```

## The Danaher Way
- Move straight from an inferior position to a counter attack
- Rather than defense then switch to offense, meld the two
``` mermaid

  A["Bottom Mount (Inferior)"] -- Kipping Escape --> B["Leg Lock (Dominant)"];
```

## The 2 Defensive Skills
1. Pin Escapes
2. Submission Escapes

## The Sunk Cost Fallacy
- The more that someone invests, the less likely they are to quit
	- They worry about losing what they have invested
- Ex: You fight for a top pin (Takedown, then guard pass, and finally achieve a pin), so you hold for dear life once you get to a pin
	- This causes you to overextend yourself and make mistakes in an effort to keep what you have
- This extension is an opportunity for the pinned person to attack
	- Joint Locks
- "A boxer is never more vulnerable than when he throws a punch"

## The Game Plan for New Wave Escape Philosophy
1. Bring limbs inside
	- Extension = Submission
2. Off-Balance (Not always needed)
3. Gain Sufficent inside control to create movement under opponent
4. Tipping Point of position(This is where things move quickly)
	- Sufficent degree of inside position to create a tipping point to where the pin is broken and you attack
	- Move from defense to offense quickly (Timing is important)
	- Moving into a counter-attack, rather than a neutral position
		- [[Leglocks |Ashi]], arm bar, [[NW The Clamp |the clamp]], etc
		- Costs nothing extra to move into an attack rather than guard
		- Don't limit yourself to guard


## [[The 5 Pins of Jiu-Jitsu]]

- When pinned in a leg dominant pin, attack the legs
- When pinned in an arm dominant pin, attack the arms, before attack the legs
	- This is because it is a more direct attack, as those limbs are connected to you
		- As the opponent pulls away, that give you opportunity to indirectly attack other limbs
	- Typically arm with dominant pins, attack arms first, as opponent pulls arms away, attack legs

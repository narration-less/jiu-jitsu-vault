New Wave Positional Escapes Vol. 4, 5, 6

![[side_elbow_overview.mp4]]
- Most effective method - Danaher
- First target are the arms, as it's an arm dominant pin
	- Most likely fail, they pull out, you attack legs

- Do not extend your limbs

1. Get elbow/forearm frame in hip
    - If arm is isolated, you have to shift away to create space to get elbow in.
2. Get knee inside other hip
    1. Get knee into pocket
    2. Get foot above knee so knee slide down into pocket
    3. Shrimp out slightly to create space for knee to go in
3. Other leg postures against framed knee and push and rotate parallel under
    1. Your head needs to be in front/ahead of opponents head
    2. Move forearm frame from hip to inside control of opponents arm to prevent head control
4. Move into [[NW The Clamp |the clamp]]

## Crossfaces:
Conventional Crossface (Note opponent's arm under Danaher's head):

Reverse Crossface (Note opponent's arm past Danaher's head):

## Role of Opponent's Head while in Side Control

- Opponents head has to be across your side.
- Hips on one side, head on the other
- If opponent's head gets to same side as side, this becomes a very weak pin

## Conventional Crossface
### Overback Grip

- Move opponent's head to the other side by bridging and moving the head with your outside bicep
    - Do not grab head or neck, extend the arm and bring across
    - Don't punch the head (dick move)
    - Thumb points down and across
### If you are framed under the neck:

1. Lift, bridge
2. Elbow goes along opponent's jaw and you rotate head to opposite shoulder (putting opponent's head on same side as his hips)
- This enables you to go straight into the side elbow escape

## Different Defensive Frame Options
- Optimally, get inside of opponent's wedges
- Inside Arm Overview 52:20, 54:20
    1. The arm that frames in the hip 50:00
    2. 50:30 Thumb post in armpit
        - Elbow in opponent's other hip closest to yours
        - Could stop sit-out pins
    3. Thumb post at the tricep 51:50
        - Good for if they like to reverse crossface
        - As they reverse, you can frame hard
    4. 53:10 Scoop Option
        - Arm goes completely under
        - Useful for [[NW Backdoor Escape (Side Control) |backdoor]] escapes

- Outside arm
    1. (Best) Reverse crossface across opponent's neck 55:00
        - Enables head movement, limits pressure they can use
        - Hand goes all the way through to wrap around their tricep
    2. Underhook 56:30
    3. Overback
        - Do not curl into head/neck

## Problem of Crossface Side Pins: Near Hip/Far Hip Connection
- The central problem that needs addressed is your opponent's far side hip to your near side hip 59:00

## Problem of Reverse Crossface Side Pins: Near Shoulder/Far Shoulder Connection

# Lateral Kipping Escape
New Wave Positional Escapes Vol. 2

## Moves into [[Leglocks]]

## Two options for kipping escape from bottom Mount

- Heel of hand on each hip bone of opponent
- 2 on 1: forearm across waist for 2 hands one hip. See 7:09 for pic
---

- Fingers are pointed outwards to prevent wrist lockslocks
- At least one of your elbows needs inside position
    - Inside opponents knee

## Main Points:

- Lateral Kipping Escape
    - Take bodyweight off to the side
    - Kip knee through to ashi
- 2 on 1
    - Effective on shorter opponents or people climbing into height chest mount

---

- Get hand/arm through for the two on one grip
    - Hip bump for space if needed
- Off balance opponent to side to misalign the centers of gravity Asymetrical bridge
    1. One foot planted, one foot/leg turns put with outside blade of foot on mat
        - Lateral Bridge over
- Tuck legs in to start to slide out and kip
- Kip in and bring on knee inside

### Notes

- Number one mistake:
    - Kipping against bodyweight
- While kipping:
    - Legs together kipping as a unit
        - One foot over another (one foot on shoelaces of other)
    - Knees against opponent's tailbone
- Use the kip to break the locked feet apart
- Kipping isn't that strong
- Used to bring knee inside
- Short rhythmic pulses are more effective than long heavy swinhs of the legs

### Mechanical Notes

- Don't kip on a flat back
    - Try to go to side and/or concave your body to minimize surface area on mat
- The kipping in unison creates a rockin effect on a curved/concave back that creates lift of opponent
- Get his belly button to the side (off-center)
    - Then you're just fighting getting the knee in, not the bodyweight as well
- Further legs deviate from tailbone, less effective

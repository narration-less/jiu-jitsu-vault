# Side Control to Mount (Against Knee Shield)

## To remove opponent’s knee from protecting getting mounted

1. Underhook arm pins hip line
    1. Hand cups opponent’s far side hip bone
    2. Elbow pins the other hip
2. Put your knee in between the space of your elbow and body
3. Lean forward and post head on mat as a base (ABOVE opponent’s shoulder line)
    1. Negates opponent’s frame in your neck
4. Now that knee is placed in opponent’s hip line, take underhook arm and post ahead of your own head to prevent sweeping, widens base (Over-post wide)
5. Slide knee through hip line and touch knee on mat
6. Bring posted hand under the elbow (elbow penetration) and walk opponent’s elbow up past shoulder line and over to far side shoulder
7. You are now in [[NW High Mount Chest Wrap]], but need to move the hip line knee
8. Can use your head as a base above opponent’s head
9. Tilt body toward the knee posted on mat and windshield wiper leg out of hip line
    - This reduces ankle exposure for opponent to use as a sweep
10. Shift into high mount (feet above opponent's hip line)
